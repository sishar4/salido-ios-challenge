# SALIDO iOS Challenge
This challenge is intended to get a better idea of a SALIDO candidate's coding style and development process. There is no hard time limit, but we ask that you send in your solution promptly.

## Submission Instructions
1. Fork this project. If you don't already have a github account, you will need one.
2. Complete the project according to the provided requirements
3. Push all changes to your fork and submit a pull request to this project. Email the SALIDO employee that interviewed you to let them know the challenge was submitted.
4. In your README, give us a brief explanation of how you approached the problem and assumptions you made. If there are any setup steps we need before running your code, list them here.

## Expectations
1. You can model data supplied by the API in a way that is simple and makes sense.
2. You can take modeled information and create an easily digestible UI around it.
3. You can utilize appropriate frameworks to make your code fast, simple, and DRY.
4. You can take a set of business requirements from end-to-end, keeping in mind how the user will interact with the final product.
