## Project Description
Imagine that Salido has just acquired a new company called ABC Wine Distributors (ABC WD) for the purpose of selling wines through Salido's existing customer-facing mobile app.

Your job is to prototype a Catalog+Cart module for iOS using ABC WD's API found here: https://api.wine.com You will need to sign up for an account to obtain your own API key.  Your application should be easy to set up, run on either an iPhone or iPad, and target a base SDK of iOS 8.0 or later.  It should not require any for-pay software, but open source 3rd party frameworks are allowed.  It does not need to support screen rotation.

Here's what your application must do:

1. List a set of products from the API.
1. View a product and any relevant details.
1. Add a product to a shopping cart.
1. Remove a product from a shopping cart.
1. Update the quantity on a product in a shopping cart.
1. Allow the user to switch between the products view and the shopping cart.
1. Have a "Proceed to Payment" button on cart which validates the shopping cart and moves to a payment screen.
1. Payment screen shows a raw JSON dump of the shopping cart.
1. Handle any API/Cart validation errors.

Your application does not need to:

1. Handle authentication or authorization.
1. Be aesthetically pleasing.
1. Handle processing a payment or any further checkout functionality.

## Evaluation
Evaluation of your submission will be based on the following criteria. 

1. Did your application fulfill the basic requirements?
1. Did you document the method for setting up and running your application?
1. Did you follow the instructions for submission?

Additionally, reviewers will attempt to assess your familiarity with standard libraries. Reviewers will also assess your experience with object-oriented programming based on how you've structured your submission. Both your code and the technical (not aesthetic) quality of the running application will be evaluated.
